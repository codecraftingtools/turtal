======
Turtal
======

The goal of this project is to define a run-time abstraction layer
that isolates high-level code from the details related to a specific
operating system, hardware, or message-passing framework
implementation.  This library will eventually provide a set of uniform
programming interfaces for constructs like message queues, threads,
file input/output, timers, and schedulers.

`Turtal`_ is part of the `Code Craftsmen`_ project.  The
`documentation`_ is hosted on `Read the Docs`_ and the `source code`_
can be found on `GitHub`_.
