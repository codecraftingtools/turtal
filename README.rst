======
Turtal
======

Turtal is the underlying run-time abstraction layer that isolates
high-level code from the details related to a specific operating
system, hardware, or message-passing framework implementation.  This
library will eventually provide a set of uniform programming
interfaces for constructs like message queues, threads, file
input/output, timers, and schedulers.

`Turtal`_ is part of the `Code Craftsmen`_ project.  The
`documentation`_ is hosted on `Read the Docs`_ and the `source code`_
can be found on `GitHub`_.
